    "##### Writing a Spec\n",
    "We will write a web application called Learning Log that allows users to log the topics they are interested in and to make journal entries as they learn about each topic. The Learning Log home page should describe the site and invite users to either register or log in. Once logged in, a user should be able to create new topics, add new entries, and read and edit existing entries.\n",

The *settings.py* file controls how Django interacts with our system and manages our project. We will modifya few of these settings and add some settings of our own. The *urls.py* file tells Django which pages to build in response to browser requests. The *wsgi.py* file helps Django serve the files it creates. The filename is an acronym for *web server gateway interface*."

    "The `text` attribute is a `CharField`-a piece of data that's made up of characters, or text. You use `CharField` when you want to store a small amount of text, such as a name, a title, or a city. When we define a `CharField` attribute, we have to tell Django how much space it should reserve in the database. Here we give it a `maxlength` of 200 characters, which should be enough to hold most topic names.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `date_added` attribute is a `DateTimeField`-a piece of data that will record a date and time. We pass the argument `auto_new_add = True`, which tells Django to automatically set this attribute to the current date and time whenever the user creates a new topic.\n",

    "Django allows us to create a user who has all privileges available on the site, called a *superuser*. A *privilege* controls the actions a user can take. The most restrictive privilege settings allow a user to only read public information on the site. Registered users typically have the privilege of reading their own private data and some selected information available only to members. To effectively administer a web application, the site owner usually needs access to all information stored on the site. A good administrator is careful with their users' sensitive information, because users put a lot of trust into the apps they access.\n",

    "##### Registering a Model with the Admin Site\n",
    "Django includes some models in the admin site automatically, such as `User` and `Group`, but the models we create need to be registered manually. When we started the `learning_logs` app, Django created a file called `admin.py` in the same directory as `models.py`:"

The admin page we see allows us to add new users and groups and change the existing ones. We can also work with data related to the `Topic` model we just defined.\n",
    "##### Adding Topics\n",
    "Now that `Topic` has been registered with the admin site, let's add our first otpic. Click **Topics** to go to the Topics page, which is mostly empty because we have no topics to manage yet. Click **Add**, and we'll see a form for adding a new topic. Enter **Chess** in the first box and click **Save**. We will be sent back to the Topics admin page, and we will see the topic we just created.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create a second topic, so we will have more data to work with. Click **Add** again, and create a second topic, **Rock Climbing**. When we click **Save**, we will be sent back to the main Topics page again, and we will see both Chess and Rock Climbing listed.\n",
    "##### Defining the Entry Model\n",
    "To record what we have learned about chess and rock climbing, we need to define a mdoel for the kinds of entries users can make in their learning logs. Each entry needs to be associated with a particular topic. This relationsip is called a *many-to-one relationship*, meaning many entries can be associated with one topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the code for the `Entry` model:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.db import models\n",
    "\n",
    "class Topic(models.Model):\n",
    "    --snip--\n",
    "    \n",

    "    \"\"\"Something specific learned about a topic.\"\"\"\n",
    "    topic = models.ForeignKey(Topic, on_delete = models.CASCADE)\n",
    "    text = models.TextField()\n",
    "    date_added = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add = True)\n",
    "\n",
    "    class Meta:\n",
    "        verbose_name_plural = \"entries\"\n",
    "\n",
    "        def __str__(self):\n",
    "            \"\"\"Return a string representation of the model.\"\"\"\n",
    "            return self.text[:50] + \"...\"\n",
    "        \n",
    "```\n",
    "The `Entry` class inherits from Django's base `Model` class, just as `Topic` did. The first attribute, `topic`, is a `ForeignKey` instance. A *foreign key* is a database term; it's a reference to another record in the database. This is the code that connects each entry to a specific topic. Each topic is assigned a key, or ID, when it's created. When Django needs to establish a connection between two pieces of data, it uses the key associated with each piece of information. We will use these connections shortly to retrieve all the entries associated with a certain topic. The `on_delete = models.CASCADE` argument tells Django that when a topic is deleted, all of the entries associated with that topic should be deleted as well. This is known as a *cascading delete*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next is an attribute called `text`, which is an instance of the `TextField`. This kind of field does not need a size limit, because we do not want to limit the size of individual entries. The `date_added` attribute allows us to present entries in the order they were created an to place a timestamp next ot each entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then nest the `Meta` class inside our `Entry` class. `Meta` holds extra info for managing a model; here it allows us to set a special attribute telling Django to use `Entries` when it needs to refer to more than one entry, otherwise Django would refer to more than one entry as \"Entrys\". Finally, the `__str__()` method tells Django which information to show when it refers to individual entries. Because an entry can be a long body of text, we tell Django to show the first 50 characters of text. We also add an ellipsis to clarify that we are not always displaying the entire entry.\n",
    "##### Migrating the Entry Model\n",
    "Because we have added a new model, we need to migrate the database again. This process will become quite familiar:\n",
    "1. We modify `models.py`\n",
    "2. Run the command `python manage.py makemigrations app_name`\n",
    "3. Run the command `python manage.py migrate`\n",

    "We can also look at the entries related to a certain topic. Earlier we defined the `topic` attribute for the `Entry` model. This was a `ForeignKey`, a connection between each entry and a topic. Django can use this connection to get every entry related to a certain topic, like this:\n",

    "To get data through a foreign key relationship, we use the lowercase name of the related model followed by an underscore and the word `set`. We use this kind of syntax when we begin to code the pages users can request. The shell is very useful for making sure our code retrieves the data we want it to. If our code works as we expect it to in the shell, we can expect it to work properly in the files we write within our prject. If our code generates errors or doesn't retrieve the data we expect it to, it's much easier to troubleshoot our code in the simple shell environment than it is within the files that generate web pages. We won't refer to the shell much, but we should continue using it to practice working with Django's syntax for accessing data stored in a project.\n",

    "**Pizzeria** Start a new project called `pizzeria` with an app called `pizzas`. Define a model `Pizza` with a field called `nsmr`, which will hold name values such as `Hawaiian` and `Meat Lovers`. Define a model called `Topping` with fields called `pizza` and `name`. The `pizza` filed should be a foreign key to `Pizza`, and `name` should be able to hold values such as `pineapple`, `Canadian bacon`, and `sausage`. \n",
